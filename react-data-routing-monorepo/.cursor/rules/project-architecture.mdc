# Project Architecture

Modular monolith built with React 19, React Router v7 (data routing), Vite, and Tailwind CSS v4.

## Directory Structure

- `root/` - App entry point, route composition, global CSS
- `modules/<name>/` - Feature modules (auth, dashboard, products, users, settings)
- `shared/auth/` - Framework-agnostic auth store, React hooks, route guards
- `shared/components/` - Reusable app-level components (ErrorBoundary, Forbidden, Paywall, etc.)
- `shared/layouts/` - Top-level layout components (RootLayout)
- `shared/ui/` - Primitive UI component library (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
- `shared/types/` - Shared TypeScript types (ModuleManifest, etc.)

## Module Conventions

Each module must have:
- `routes.ts` - RouteObject defining the module's route subtree
- `layout.tsx` - Module layout component (exported as `Component`)
- `pages/` - Page components (lazy-loaded)
- `index.ts` - Barrel export with a `ModuleManifest` object

## Import Rules

- Use path aliases for cross-directory imports: `@root/`, `@modules/`, `@shared/`
- Always include `.ts`/`.tsx` extensions on all local imports
- Within a module's internal files, use relative paths (e.g., `../hooks/useAuth.ts`)
- Never import from another module's internal files — only from its `index.ts`
